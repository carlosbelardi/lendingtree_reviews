I am thankful for the  mortgage analyst for guiding me through it with patience, humor and a great deal of understanding when it at times became frustating.  The frustrations were all due to rules and regulations that exist to protect the me, the consumer as well as the lenders, however at the time it didn't always seem like it!  Ms. Oula \"Suzanne\" Horn, however, navigated the process successfully and left me feeling confident that I received the best deal for my circumstances and that all the i's were dotted and t's were crossed.  She answered questions and provided information that I needed to be confident and comfortable duriing the whole process.  I would recommend Reliance First Capital to family and friends and Ms. Horn as a professional who is a very thorough and thoughtful mortgage analyst.",

My refi was complicated  and l lost hope for mortage lenders. When Bridget called and we spoke I was like here we go they tell you good news up front then call a different department and everything changes and keeps changing for the wrost. If there was was fairy godmother Bridget is it and my prayers were answered.  With a ton of changes, back and forth emails, phone calls, numbers fling all over the place do to me changing things and aking a million questions ok more like a zillion questions, Bridget was extremely helpful, return my calls and emails fast, plolit and professional. She followed up on everything (I want to express everything) explained everything to me NO SUPRISES.  I loved seeing her number show up on my caller ID it made me smile.  I was like oh yeah we are getting closer to the finish line and every phone call I got good news. I've never had such a smooth closeing within 2 months from our first call even with hurrince that hit and my appriral had to be rescheduled still closed in 2 months.  I highly recommend to everyone.",
